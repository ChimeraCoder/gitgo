Gitgo provides functions for interacting with Go repositories. 

Unlike libgit2, which is written in C, Gitgo is written in pure Go, and can be compiled and cross-compiled easily for all platforms supported by Go.


Installation
--------------

`
$ go get github.com/ChimeraCoder/gitgo
`


Usage
---------

Full documentation is available on [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ChimeraCoder/gitgo).

Gitgo is a library intended to be used by other applications, rather than a replacement for the `git` command-line tools. However, gitgo does provide the `gitgo` binary, which is used for testing the gitgo library functions and demonstrating their functionality:

`
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ChimeraCoder/gitgo
$ gitgo log 1d833eb5b6c5369c0cb7a4a3e20ded237490145f

Parse git object into struct and add corresponding test


commit: a7f92c920ce85f07a33f948aa4fa2548b270024f
Add CatFile function and corresponding test


commit: 97eed02ebe122df8fdd853c1215d8775f3d9f1a1
First commit. Create .gitignore
`

Note that the `gitgo` binary does not support all (or even most) of the functions provided by the gitgo library; it is intended for demonstration purposes and testing only.
